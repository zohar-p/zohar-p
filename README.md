### Hi, I'm Zohar ðŸ‘‹

I am a Fullstack Web Developer with a passion for programming, I like tackling complex issues and turning them into simple and elegant solutions. I am fascinated with how real-world problems can be modeled into software and I enjoy solving them with neatly structured, self-explaining code. I believe that deeply understanding the product and the business is key to produce efficient software solutions and making the customer happy.

I strive for constant improvement and I'm exceptionally self-disciplined, which results in a natural ability to teach myself new things quickly. Upon looking at my next work position, my first priority is to further develop my technical and soft skills. I see myself working in a highly professional environment with skillfull people to share knowledge with.

I'm a big fan of Eric Evans (DDD), Uncle Bob (Clean Architecture) and Martin Fowler (Refactoring).


I'm currently working as a Backend Developer in Anagal Next on a fintech project using NodeJS, LoopBack4 and CouchDB.

I love sport and being active, nowadays I mostly play Tennis.
